# This is to test Markdown syntax

OK, so let's test **bold typeface** or *italic*.

And now ***bold italic***?

## Some sub section

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Sub-item 2a
  * Sub-item 2b
* Item 3

1. First
2. Second

> No idea whom to quote.
> ??

`<html><unknowntag /></html>`

## 2nd sub

GFM: see if this leads to issue #3

And some code:
```batchfile
    @echo off
    :: A comment
    set
```

Enough now.
