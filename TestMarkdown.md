# This is to test Markdown syntax

OK, so let's test **bold typeface** or *italic*.

And now ***bold italic***?

## Some sub section

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Sub-item 2a
  * Sub-item 2b
* Item 3

1. First
2. Second

> No idea whom to quote.
> ??

`<html><unknowntag /></html>`

## 2nd sub

A link: [This project](https://github.com/mar-scha/hello-world)

* GFM: see if this leads to issue 2: #2
* Mentioning me: @mar-scha

OK, doesn't work here, but should do in commit comments

And some code:
```batchfile
    @echo off
    :: A comment
    set
```

Enough now.
